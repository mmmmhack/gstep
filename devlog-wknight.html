<h1>Development Log - wknight - gstep</h1>

<h2>2011-06-01</h2>

<p>
Starting on use of bstrlib in the code.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-02</h2>

<p>
Finished compile fixes yesterday, today, will start debugging (currently hangs, think I know what
the problem is). I'm tempted to use pyclewn, which might take a little more time, but I want to
get comfortable with it.
</p>

<p>
Man, pyclewn is sweet. Now I can really dive into knowing gdb while living in my favorite little
world of vim. So far, I was able to start Pyclewn, send commands to gdb using ':C...', start
and step through the gstep program, examine data in various formats, observe that my suspicion
was correct about where the program was getting stuck (failed to match the gdb terminator sequence
in the read buffer), and also note that the next read from gstep stdout was a blocking read.
Then I was able to send a 'Csigint' through pyclewn to interrupt the program and resume
interaction with gdb. All from the comfort of vim. Great stuff!
</p>

<p>
This is the development environment that RMS and disciples had with EMACS/gdb that I as a VI
apostate have been missing for so long.
</p>

<p>
Still lots of stuff to figure out with pyclewn. Such as, currently the clewn console always wants
to appear on top. But I'll work all that out in time, right now it's very usable as is.
Now is also probably the time to really start learning to use the c quick-fix features of vim.
</p>

<p>
Bug fixed! Program is currently working as expected. Next: start adding some parsing routines
to detect gdb output. First though, I'm adding this project to svn.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-10</h2>

<p>
Completed my first socket program in C for client-server communication. Will now incorporate
that into the gstep program. The initial version will simply server as an interface between
gdb and clients like vim.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-12</h2>

<p>
Sunday morning, have time to code. Communication between client and server is working. 
Initial command handling is working. Next: starting on gdb launch code. First, will
check in to subversion.
</p>

<p>
Later in the day, added more debugging, which is helpful, because currently I'm debugging
an issue where the forked gserver process fails and exits on exec gdb (because of bad gdb_args
I believe) and I need to find a good way for the parent process to determine whether or not the
exec of the child process succeeds.
</p>

<p>
One way that occurs to me, after a little thought, is for the parent process to wait around
for the maximum time it would take for the faild child process to die and then check the
state using 

<h2>2011-06-13</h2>

<p>
This morning, a little coding, got some Makefile issues worked out and first unit
test running to reveal that the algorithm for timeval subtraction is total bollocks.
Not sure why, I got it from the doc for libc.
</p>

<p>
No matter, I will just implement a simpler version of the algorithm.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-14</h2>

<p>
Another day, a little more coding time. I'm still sick. Will finish up unit tests for
time_sub() and then get back to work on the gdb code.
</p>

<p>
time_sub works, now I can catch the child process failure using waitpid():
</p>
<pre>

</p>

<p>
It takes a suprisingly long time to detect the failure, in my opinion, too
close to the 100 msec limit, so I'll increase to 200 msec for now.
</p>

<p>
In addition, I should probably always call waitpid() with WNOHANG before
every access of the child process and make sure it returns 0 to check
if the child process died at some point. Think I'll just create an 
is_child_running() function.
</p>

<p>
Got gdb running. Next: add code to terminate gdb when gserver exits (currently
doesn't work).
</p>

<p>
After work, little coding, added kill, looks like it works:

<h2>2011-06-15</h2>

<p>
Only a little time to code this morning, I want to make progress. Will try to finish up all the start/stop
stuff and then move on to relaying actual gdb commands.
</p>

<p>
Changed a bunch of return codes, now detection of child gdb startup is failing.
Ah, duh, I changed the meaning of my return codes. Must be consistent and use ret==0 for success
always.
</p>

<p>
Hm, ok, that's fixed, but how we have a zombie:

<h2>2011-06-16</h2>

<p>
Woke up very early this morning, but only got up at 5:10 am, so just a moderate amount of
time for programming. Reading about process termination first.
</p>

<p>
Getting there, I just remembered that a terminated child will become a zombie until its
termination status is reported to the parent (I think). So one possibility is for the
gserver app to wait for a bit after killing the gdb process, before quitting.
</p>

<p>
Yeah, but, after reading this, why was it a zombie after the gserver process terminated
(from linux programming interface):
</p>
<pre>
On the other 
hand, if the parent terminates without doing a wait(), then the init process adopts 
the child and automatically performs a wait(), thus removing the zombie process 
from the system. 
</pre>

<p>
Uh, because you left the parent process still running, dumbkopf. Ok, this is could,
I am finally understanding the nature of zombies and how to deal with them.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-17</h2>

<p>
Truly no time for code, but want to do a tiny bit anyhow.
</p>

<p>
gdb shutdown is working.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-19</h2>

<p>
Sunday morning, back from Lymefest.
</p>

<p>
Working on 'gdb cmd'. Looks like gdb i/o is working from the server end, now
probs on the client. Adding more logging there.
</p>

<p>
Identified the problem: current client code expects empty newline (as done
by gserver responses which end with HTTP status). Need to consider how to
handle responses from gdb process.
</p>

<p>
Thoughts in the shower: the client should read a response from the server
until the socket is closed. The HTTP status line should be sent first,
followed by the output from the gdb process.
</p>

<p>
Next, working on fixing detection of end of gdb output. When gdb outputs
to console stdout and input is from keyboard stdin, an input of an empty
line with only newline produces my current spec for gdb terminator:
</p>
<pre>
...
Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "i386-apple-darwin".
(gdb) 
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
However, when the input to gdb comes from one pipe and the output goes out
another, here's what the same input produces in the output stream:
</p>
<pre>
Type "show copying" to see the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type "show warranty" for details.
This GDB was configured as "i386-apple-darwin".
(gdb) (gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
For now, I can easily fix this by dropping the leading '\n' from the gdb_terminator
spec. And I won't worry about possible false terminator that could show up in dumping
code because at some point I'll switch to the mi interpreter and detect the much
less ambiguous output termination sequences such as:
</p>
<pre>
show version
&amp;"show version\n"
~"GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-966) (Tue Mar 10 02:43:13 UTC 2009)\n"
~"Copyright 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n"
~"GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are\nwelcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.\nType \"show copying\" to see the conditions.\nThere is absolutely no warranty for GDB.  Type \"show warranty\" for details.\n"
~"This GDB was configured as \"i386-apple-darwin\".\n"
^done
(gdb) 
</pre>

<p>
Next, I added code to close the socket on the server side, but the client side is
still hanging in recv(). More to learn about sockets I guess...
</p>

<p>
From the logs I can see that the client makes the recv call
before the serve closes the socket, but I don't understand why
it wouldn't return right after the server closes it.
</p>

<p>
Next, I'll re-read the docs on recv().
</p>

<p>
Did that, no clues. The socket shows as still connected by lsof
</p>

</pre>

<p>
Next, will probably start logging more info on connected socket and ports.
</p>

<p>
Reading and thinking - what I'm reading tells me that closing the socker on the server side should cause
a 0 to be returned to the client in a recv() call. Is closing the 'listen' socket required? That doesn't
seem to make any sense.
</p>

<p>
I may start making calls to getsockopt() and investigating the current values I find.
</p>

<p>
Another thing I might do is investigate the current behavior in Linux and see if it's the same.
</p>

<p>
Maybe I have to do some kind of flush() call?
</p>

<p>
Later, more read. Everything I'm reading says that 'close' should shut the damn thing down. Will
try 'shutdown()' instead. I'm thinking that after close, the server side state should definitely
be 'FIN_WAIT_...', not 'ESTABLISHED' like it's currently showing:
</p>
<pre>
gserver   76902 williamknight    3u  IPv4 0x5345e64      0t0  TCP *:6667 (LISTEN)
gclient   76909 williamknight    3u  IPv4 0x533de64      0t0  TCP localhost:50885-&gt;localhost:6667 (ESTABLISHED)
gdb-i386- 76910 williamknight    3u  IPv4 0x5345e64      0t0  TCP *:6667 (LISTEN)
gdb-i386- 76910 williamknight    4u  IPv4 0x533d270      0t0  TCP localhost:6667-&gt;localhost:50885 (ESTABLISHED)
</pre>

<p>
Wait, maybe that's the answer? Is the child gdb process inheriting the ESTABLISHED socket connections
and preventing the close somehow? I can understand it inheriting the 'listening' socket, but 
it doesn't make sense to me right now that it inherits the 'accepted' socket. Think I might add
a debug command 'client wait' where the server will respond with nothing and the client will
wait for a response, just to take a look at the state of the connections in that situation.
</p>

<p>
w/o gdb running:

</pre>

<h2>2011-06-20</h2>

<p>
Little monday-morning coding. Wrote a test server/client echo test that confirmed that closing
the 'accept' socket on server side shuts down client receive. Next, need to combine that with
creating a child process.
</p>

<p>
Excellent, forked a child process after the accept but before the echo, confirmed that it holds
the client in recv() call even after the parent process closes both sockets. So that's it.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-21</h2>

<p>
Up early, will try to get this thing working. Will just start by closing the socket fd in
any gdb forked process that occurs.
</p>

<p>
Did that, I believe I also need to close the accept socket.
</p>

<p>
That did it, I'm finally getting output from gdb to the client!
</p>

<p>
Need a little more cleanup on the server side (closing sockets), and then next:
start passing actual gdb_cmd args to gdb.
</p>
