<h1>Development Log - wknight - gstep</h1>

<h2>2011-06-01</h2>

<p>
Starting on use of bstrlib in the code.
</p>

<h2>2011-06-02</h2>

<p>
Finished compile fixes yesterday, today, will start debugging (currently hangs, think I know what
the problem is). I'm tempted to use pyclewn, which might take a little more time, but I want to
get comfortable with it.
</p>

<p>
Man, pyclewn is sweet. Now I can really dive into knowing gdb while living in my favorite little
world of vim. So far, I was able to start Pyclewn, send commands to gdb using ':C...', start
and step through the gstep program, examine data in various formats, observe that my suspicion
was correct about where the program was getting stuck (failed to match the gdb terminator sequence
in the read buffer), and also note that the next read from gstep stdout was a blocking read.
Then I was able to send a 'Csigint' through pyclewn to interrupt the program and resume
interaction with gdb. All from the comfort of vim. Great stuff!
</p>

<p>
This is the development environment that RMS and disciples had with EMACS/gdb that I as a VI
apostate have been missing for so long.
</p>

<p>
Still lots of stuff to figure out with pyclewn. Such as, currently the clewn console always wants
to appear on top. But I'll work all that out in time, right now it's very usable as is.
Now is also probably the time to really start learning to use the c quick-fix features of vim.
</p>

<p>
Bug fixed! Program is currently working as expected. Next: start adding some parsing routines
to detect gdb output. First though, I'm adding this project to svn.
