To build it, just type 'make'.
To install, you could create symlinks to the 2 binaries, 'gserver' and 'gclient' to
your bin directory, if desired.

To try it out, run 'gserver' in one shell window and fire up vim in another
and try sourcing the 'gclient.vim' script.

Better instructions coming soon!
