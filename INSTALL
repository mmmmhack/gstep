To build it, just type 'make'.

To install, type 'make install'. It will attempt to install a few files locally,
you may need to create some directories or adjust to your preference:

2 binaries are installed via symlinks created in ~/bin, which is assumed to be in your $PATH: 
	$ ln -s $(CURDIR)/gserver ~/bin/gserver
	$ ln -s $(CURDIR)/gclient ~/bin/gclient

The gclient.vim plugin is installed by doing:
	$ cp gclient.vim ~/.vim/plugins/
	$ cp glcient.txt ~/.vim/doc/
	
Then, register help for the plugin in vim by doing:
	:helptags ~/.vim/doc

after that, you can do:
	:help gclient

To try it out, run 'gserver' in one shell window and fire up vim in another. See
the instructions in the plugin help for more details.
