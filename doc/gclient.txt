NAME
      gclient - gdb client program

SYNOPSIS
      gclient [-h] [request_string]

DESCRIPTION
      The purpose of gclient is to receive a request string from the command-line and
      relay it through a socket connection to a gserver program running gdb.
      gclient will then read the response from the gserver program and output
      it to stdout.

      The intended use of gclient is to provide a debugging interface from
      within a vim session, similar to other tools such as pyclewn.
