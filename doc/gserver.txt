NAME
      gserver - gdb server program

SYNOPSIS
      gserver [-h] [-v]

DESCRIPTION
      The purpose of gserver is to receive a request string from the gclient
      program through a socket connection and relay it to a gdb child process.
      gserver then reads the response from gdb and sends it back to the gclient
      program.

      The intended use of gserver in conjunction with gclient is to provide a 
      debugging interface from within a vim session, similar to other tools such 
      as pyclewn.

SETUP
      The gserver program listens and accepts socket connections on port 6667. At 
      this time, there is no means for specifying a different port address, but
      an option for this will be added in a subsequent version.

GENERAL
      The gserver program continually listens for and processes requests from 
      the socket connection.  Each request string consists of a command
      name, and in some cases followed by an argument.

      Below is the list of commands and resulting actions:

        start_gdb
          Starts a gdb child process, terminating any running gdb process first.

        gdb_cmd COMMAND_STRING
          Sends COMMAND_STRING to the gdb child process and reads a response.

        quit_gdb
          Terminates any running gdb process

        quit_gserv
          Exists the gserver program, terminating any running gdb process first.

        debug_no_respond
          Receives the command from the gclient process but doesn't do any
          subsequent action.

      Except for the 'debug_no_respond' command, all other commands will result
      in a response sent to the gclient program.  If the command is processed
      successfully, the response "200 OK\n" is sent, otherwise an error
      response is sent. Below are the following response codes and
      descriptions:

          200 OK
          400 Bad Request
          501 Not Implemented
          502 Gdb Failed To Stop
          503 Gdb Failed To Start
          504 Gdb Not Running
          505 Failed Sending Gdb Command
          506 Failed Receiving Gdb Response

EXAMPLES
      Below is a typical session occurring in 2 different terminals. First the gserver
      is started:

        mhackslab:gstep $ ./gserver

      In a second terminal, 5 gclient commands are given and the resulting output from gdb is
      shown:

        --- Start gdb:

          mhackslab:gstep $ ./gclient start_gdb

          (gdb) 
          mhackslab:gstep $ 

        --- Tell gserver to quit:

          mhackslab:gstep $ ./gserver quit_gserv

          mhackslab:gstep $
